                    Originally incorporated as “New Gibraltar” in 1839, it was renamed almost a decade alter as “Stone Mountain”. Stone Mountain is most famous for its namesake, the great granite dome that lies 16 miles east of Atlanta. Today Stone Mountain is a popular tourist destination known for its hiking and camping opportunities, and its historic village including the sky-lift cable cars and a 1940's train.
